## :speech_balloon: Intro

This repository contains the work performed by our Team in application of the concepts learn at **Social Network Analysis** course. When we started brainstorming ideas for our Social Network Analysis final project, we discovered that **The Lord of the Rings** was not only hugely successful, but also had many characters and a complex web of interactions between them. This reason, together with the fact that many of the group members have grown up reading the books and watching the movies, have pushed us, like Frodo, to embark on a journey to try to discover how the social world created by Tolkien really looks like.

## :rocket: How to use this repository

Here, you'll just one notebook, as well as a folder containing the needed datasets and images.

## :package: Notebook introduction

The notebook is well explained and you will find an appropiate storytelling aligned with the code itself. The notebook starts by introducing our **scope, data and references**, as well as **preparing the data**. We will perform an initial **Exploratory Data Analysis** to get a better understanding of our data and, then, we will dig in the SNA aspects:

- **Creation of a graph using Networkx**
- Calculation of **Centrality Measures** (Weighted Degree, Eigenvector, Betweenness and Closeness)
- **Community Detection** (applying Girvan-Newman, Louvain and CNM algorithms)
- **Information Diffusion** (using the Independent Cascade Model)
- **Sentiment Analysis** (per chapters and per characters, using the SentiWordNet dataset)

## :mag: References

We cannot end our project without mentioning some projects that we have used as inspiration and that has provided us with some of the techniques specially for treating the data at a first point:

- Specially, the work "Analysing Lord of the Rings Trilogy with Data Science". A project by Nab-88 available on Github (https://github.com/Nab-88/social-graphs-and-interactions)
- "The complex social network from The Lord of The Rings" by Mauricio Aparecido Ribeiro, Roberto Antonio Vosgerau, Maria Larissa Pereira Andruchiw, Sandro Ely de Souza Pinto
- "Analyzing the Lord of the Rings data" a Kaggle project by xvivancos.
